# Console Components
These components are those which are used across the console, but are not exposed in the SDK.

We redefine them here as the monitoring-console-plugin is deployed across a number of OCP versions, and as such it is better
for our PF5 version to maintain the same components in our codebase which is shared across all PF5 OCP versions rather than
add them to the version unstable SDK.
