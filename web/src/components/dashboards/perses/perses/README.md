# Perses Files
These files are copied from perses to get access to methods which aren't exposed currently.

This was done mostly since we are still discussing how we will want to hook things like datasources up.

Once a decision has been reached for that, we can go ahead and either expose these files in perses or
find alternatives of our own.
